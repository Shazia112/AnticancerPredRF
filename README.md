# Abstract
Cancer is a life-threatening disease that is caused via distinct variations (mutations) in the cell’s DNA, causing a prolonged uncontrolled cell division that widely impacts other tissues, resulting in the formation oftumor masses. Anticancer Peptides are series of short peptides that bind to and kill cancer cells either by direct or
indirect-acting mechanism. Mainstream approaches practice traditional ways such as radiotherapy, chemotherapy,and biopsy to predict anticancer peptides (ACPs) that are laborious and tedious in processing. Regarding this, computationally intelligent approaches are vastly focused to identify the diseases such as ACPs, with reasonable precision and accuracy. In this article, firstly, the ACPs datasets are initially collected from Cancer PPD, APD3 and Swiss database. Next, the equivalent numerical features are extracted using a hybrid approach of statistical moments and Amino Acid Composition (AAC). The extracted features are fed into a bagging algorithm to learn
the input data variables. Finally, the assessment is performed via several evaluation metrics such as independent testing, jackknife, self–consistency and 10-fold cross validation where the proposed method outperformed over the existing state-of-the-arts. The proposed model achieved accuracy of 99.13%, 98.87%, 98.95%, and 98.25% for independent validation, jackknife, self -consistency, and 10-fold cross-validation, respectively.
